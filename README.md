# QuestionPro

## Overview

This project is built using React and implements various features and concepts covered in the Winter PEP sessions.
It demonstrates best practices in code structure, UI/UX design, and overall functionality.
It contains Express Backend code as well that queries a db with 100k plus questions.
The questions are stored in a MongoDB Atlas Cluster.

## Features and Concepts Implemented
